# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

The purpose of this lab is to showcase my knowledge on how to set up, configure, and ingest logs to Wazuh; then utilize SOAR to perform automation. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Wazuh
- Shuffle, a SOAR platform, to perform automation

## Steps

- Create a diagram and map out how I wanted to build out my lab logically. This diagram helps understand how data will flow and what we need to install.  
- Install Wazuh
- Have at least one agent reporting in
- Integrate a SOAR platform such as Shuffle and perform simple automation such as data enrichment
